# spring-boot

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to create microservices and web applications. It is built on top of the Spring framework and uses convention over configuration, meaning that it can be used to build production-ready applications with minimal configuration.

Spring Boot provides a number of features to make it easy to develop and deploy microservices and web applications, including:

Starters: Pre-configured dependencies that can be included in your application to enable certain features, such as web server support or database connectivity.

Auto-configuration: Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the dependencies that are present on the classpath.

Command-line interface: Spring Boot includes a command-line interface that can be used to quickly create and run applications.

Embedded web servers: Spring Boot includes support for embedded web servers such as Tomcat and Jetty, making it easy to deploy your application as a standalone application.

Spring Boot is a popular choice for building microservices and web applications due to its simplicity and the many features it provides out of the box.

Spring Boot is used to create stand-alone, production-grade applications that are easy to deploy and maintain. It is commonly used to build microservices and web applications, although it can be used to build other types of applications as well.

Spring Boot is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal configuration, making it a popular choice for developers who want to get up and running quickly.

Here are a few examples of applications that could be built using Spring Boot:

Web application: Spring Boot can be used to build a web application that provides a user interface to users via a web browser.

Microservice: Spring Boot can be used to build a microservice, which is a small, independent service that performs a specific function and communicates with other services via APIs.

REST API: Spring Boot can be used to build a REST API, which is a web service that allows clients to perform actions and access data over HTTP.

Task scheduler: Spring Boot can be used to build a task scheduler, which is a component that executes tasks at pre-determined intervals.

Command-line application: Spring Boot can be used to build a command-line application, which is a program that is run from the command line rather than a graphical user interface.

These are just a few examples of the types of applications that can be built using Spring Boot. The framework is flexible and can be used to build a wide range of applications.
